Identifying Problems wiht Hard Disk Systems
    Symptom - slow performance or read/write failures
    Causes - failing drive or lack of available space (-10%)
    Fix - Optimize disk - perform disk refragmentation
    Free Up Space - Relocate files & remove old applications to gain needed space

    Symptom - Unable to boot the OS
    Causes - BIOS unable to recognize the hard drive. Operating system cannot be found
    Fix - Ensure BIOS properly detects hard drive - check and reseat connections
        Boot into Windows recovery environment
            use command line
            execute the bootrec/fixmbr - rebuilds the master boot record
            execute the bootrec/fixboot - rebuilds teh boot sector

    Determines drives funtionsal status
    Indicates drives shortcomings
        uses various metrics
        difficult to interpret - due to lack of indudstry standards
    Benefits manuafacturers more than end-users
        Analysis detect design flaws
        Product Improvement

    Redundant Array of Independent Disks
    RAID Issues
    Isolating the cause is complicated
        multiple drives used in the Array
        integrated vs installed controllers
        software RAID issues challenging to diagnose
    Depends on RAID configuration used
        hardware-based RAID
        Windows Disk Management utility (software RAID)
        Array affected, but data is not lost - fault-tolerant design

    Identifying Optical Drive Issues
    Physical drive Problems
        power connections - eject the tray to confirm power is applied
    Data cable is properly attached
        SATA connector uses 'key' for proper attachment
            IDE cable connection must be oriented with a pin 1 (colored stripe on edge)
        Allows BIOS to detect installation of optical drive

    Typical issues are realated to 'disc' media (logical)
    Symptom - Unable to read data from disc
    Causes - inappropirate media type inserted in drive. dirty disc surface
    Fix - leverage backward-compatibility concepts - DVD to read CDs and Blu-Rays or CDs. clean discs using recommended solution.

Troubleshooting Video Issues
    Symptom - Booting into VGA mode
        (VGA mode is the standard resolution of 640x480)
    Causes - video card cannot support higher resolution setting. or video cards driver is not loading properly.
    Fix - reset the video cards resolution to one it can handle
        reinstall driver if booting to VGA mode persists
        replace the video card if both attempts do not work.

    Symptom - no image on the screen (desktop)
    Causes - monitor is not working
        probable video card malfunction after checking monitor
    Fix - substitute know good monitor for the suspected bad one
        reseat video card if switching monitors do not work
        reinstall video cards driver if problem still exists
        lastly, replae the video card because it is not working

    Symptom - no image on the screen (laptops)
    Causes - LCD is not working
    Fix - Confirm power is applied to the laptop
        toggle the display using the appropriate function key (reboot if persists)
        if reboot does not display BIOS informtion, replace display
        problem is a windows issue when:
            BIOS information appears during reboot then LCD goes blank
            boot into VGA mode to reset resolution or reinstall driver
        replace display if al esle fails to correct problem
