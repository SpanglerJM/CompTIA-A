    Common Troubleshooting Steps
        Rebooting
            Terminates 'stuck' process suitably. Resumes at the point of stoppage upon restart. Verifies functionality of affected process (STEP 6).
        Restarting Services
            to effect specific changes. restart manually or automatically. options are restart computer or run aprogram.
        Fixing Application Issues
            crashing or erratic operation. critical files are affected by another application. Repair first, then un/reinstall.
        Application Requirements and Resources
            vendors specificaiton. Memory, storage, and GPU speed may specify SSD hard drive. may need hardware upgrade.
        System File Checks
            scans and replaces critical system files. CMD 'sfc.exe'. Windows Recovery Enviro - used when the OS does not boot up.
        Repairing Windows
            Corrects any Windows OS issue.. Repair installation. replaces all system files and apps. user installed apps and files remain intact unless decided not to.
        Restoring Windows
            using system restore utility. easier method to recover from major OS issues. select restore point. must have system protection enabled. Before software isntallations. Control Panel access and settings app. Windows must be able to boot.
        Reimagining/Reloading the OS
            Common network administrative practice. System image recovery. Reset this PC, Get started, remove everything. Factory recovery partition. LAST RESORT.
        Microsoft Updates
            Hardens software against exploits. Auto on W11. Large-scale: corporate patch-management solution. WSUS. SOHO: one-off update installation.
        Rolling Back Device drivers
            Issues caused by faulty driver. Performed in Device Manager, requires a system reboot.
        Rebuilding Windows Profiles
            remediation for local user profile related issues. requires the affected profile to be deleted. Admin privileges. backup the local users profile. Users profile will be deleted but must not be moved. Lastly, user must sign in to create anew profile. Roaming profiles provide logon flexibility to selected users. Logging in loads their same profile from a server that stores users roaming profile. 
    Troubleshooting Sedurity Issues
        Learn computer infection symptoms. Wuarantine infected system immediately. use proactive measures, Protection like antivirus/malware, System hardening like software patches, Prevention like threat awareness, user education.

    Best Practices for Malware Removal
        1. Identify and research malware symptoms - observe computers behavior/ malfunction
        2. Quarantine - Prevent virus replication or spread of malware
        3. Disable System restore - deletes all restore points
        4. Remediate Infected Systems - actual removal of virus or malware infection. update antivirus/ antimalware, Windows Recovery Enviro.
        5. Schedule scans and run Updates - periodic scans through task scheduler. Windows Defender Security scans while the OS is idle, updates are checked daily.
        6. Enable sysem restore and create a restore point - turn the System Protection back on. manually create a restor point. Identify snapshot with appropriate description.
        7. Educate the end user - training, annual requirement. Employees review current updated policies.
