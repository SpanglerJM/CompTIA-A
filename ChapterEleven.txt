Troubleshooting Methodology and Resolving Core Hardware Problems

Steps
Identify the Problem
Establish a Theory
Test the Theory
Establish a Plan of Action
Verify Functionality
Document Findings

Main troubleshooting considerations
    backup data before making any system change
    prioritize reported issue
        1st issuethat affect multiple users
        2nd individual complaints
    Elaborate on a written synopsis of the resolution
        repair/recovery procedures applied
        steps taken to resolve the issues

1. Identify the Problem
    Individual or collective Hardware
    Operating System
    Application or software program
    end-user

    Can you show me the problem?
    How often does this happen?
    Has any new hardware or software been installed recently
    hos the computer been boved? has someone who mormally doesnt use the computer recendly used it?
    have any other changes been made to the computer recently

2. Establish a Theory
    Reboot
    Visually Inspect
    Check for connections internal and external

3. Test the Theory
    will restarting the computer help?
    are the cables pluggedi in?
    is the system ready?
    do the chips and cables need to be reseated
    is the problem user error?

4. Establish a Plan of Action
    test reasons 
    keep attempting to fix
    new ideas or escelate
    one solution at a Time

5. Verify Functionality
    confirmation of complete Functionality
        upon resolution of the problem that was initially addressed
        determine that the problem was resolved
        personal acknowledgement from user
        if possible, implement preventive measures
        correct hazardous and fault-providing conditions 

6. Document Findings
    recorded information regarding 
        findings and investigations of cause
        actions and planned steps taken to correct the Problem
        outcomes of the problems solbed or next issue.
    use personal notes and record as you work
    system based documetnation includes historical record of services performed on equipment, electronic knowledge base resource and company wide incident repository


Outdated BIOS
    unable to support new technologies
    update by flashing the BIOS
Loss of BIOS setup configuration
    BIOS setup configuration stored in CMOS RAM
    maintained by battery when PC is turned off, i.e. RAM is volatile storage
    dead battery causes loss of configuration settings
PC unable to boot, i.e., load the operating system
    error message after ports
Suspect BIOS setup configuration
    Boot sequence
        uses firt device lsited, typically a hard drive
        may be set to boot from the optical drive
            'no OS found' if non-bootable disc is inserted
            'no boot device' if tray is empty

POST 
    BIOS executes the 'Power on Self-Test' program
        when power is applied
    Tests all critical syste hardware for basic Functionality
        RAM
        CPU 
        Video
        North Bridge
        South Bridge 
POST Routine Problems
    beep codes 
        when an issue si detected before video is tested
        single - indicates no problems detected
        multiple - indicator of problems detected
        varies according to BIOS manufacturer/ version
            specific duration and pattern relates to specific component
POST Card - alternate method to determine problems
    detected during the POST
    installs to a PCIe or PCI slot, and USB port
    displays numeric codes
        represents a specific component checked during POST 

##### Toubleshooting Problems with Motherboards, CPUs, RAM and Power #####
Identifying Motherboard and CPU Problems
    Complete system failure
    sus;ect bad motherboard and/or CPU
    include other possibilites like issue wiht memory (DIMM) or bad power supply (PSU)
    locks up or 'hangs'
    stuck in a reboot loop

Motherboard problems
    physical trauma - dropped or environmental effects
    electrostatic discharge 
        lack of preventive measures taken - grounding chords, and wrist straps, shielded packaging, bench manufacturers
    short-circuiting - foreign or loose metallic parts/ screws
        comes in contact with soldered leads of components
CPU problems
    seldom due to physical trauma
    frequently caused from overheating
    improper installation
        fan and heatsing - cooling system
        ineffectiven ess or absence of thermal compound
        incorrect orientation onto socket - nothces or bevel alignment

I/O Port and Cable Problems
    failures may occur does to neglect when used
        attempting to attach cable with dirty or damaged connectors
    Isolate the cause of the problems
        cables are connected properly
        ports are enabled in the BIOS setup/ device manager in windows
    Test your theories
        check suspected bad ports using a loopback pluggedi
        determine if the cable is bad by swapping it out with a known good one
        may need to 'ohm-out' the wires bewtween connectors (multimeter)
Black Screen
    Symtom of no video output
    Eliminate the obvious theories
        monitors power cable properly connected to an AC outlet
        monitor is turned on
        video cable is properly connected to boththe video card port and the monitor jack 
        if available, substitute the mnonitor with a known good one
    Onboard video component
        if bad, does not mean the mohterboard NEEDS replacing, install a video card in an expansion slot and substitute with a known good adapter
    Video cable
        swap out wiht aknown good cable 
Capacitor Overview
    Stores electricity on the motherboard - to be used by specific circuits at a particular Time
    provides appropriate timed delivery of stred voltage by design, sent to applicable circuits when specific relays are endergized
    Has vatied life expectancy - shortened when becoming distended
    Swelling AKA distended Capacitor
        bulding is the first sign  of bad motherboard symptoms
        leak of electrolyte (reddish-brown) require immediate replacement
    IT technicians not recommended to replace capacitors - not certified to repair electronic circuitry

Identifying Memory Issues and Identifying Power Supply Problems
