    Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)
        uses high speed packed access (HSPA+)
    Code-Division Multiple access
        usses evolution-data optimized technology (EV-DO)

    Dependent on service provider
    GSM -AT&T
    CDMA - TMobile and Verizon

    Varied data rates
        200kbps to 7mbps download

4G 2008
    Uses IP conectivity instead of telephone circuits (3G)
    Mobile broadband access
        WiMax
        Long-Term Evolution (LTE)

    Vaied data rates for LTE due to cell tower height
        300mbps down / 75mbps up theoretical
        10-20mbps down / 3-10mbps up actual

5G 2018
    Classifications
        Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB)

        Massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC)

    Varied data rates
    20gbps down (theoretical)
    1gbps down (actual)

    600mhz to 6ghz range

Airplane Mode - cuts off all emitters 

Baseband OS
    manages all wireless Communications
    talks to the various manufacturers radio firmware
    manages the radio frequency (RF) componentson behalf of the devicesprimary operating system 

Real-Time OS's - SIM OS
    subscriber identity module OS
        manages all data transfers between the phone and SIM chip
    stores account info, phone ID, and security data

    SIM chips are carrier specific

Preferred Roaming List PRL
    reference guide for the phone when Roaming
Updating
    normally wpdated with the primary OS
    Some carriers allow you to dial a specific number

Email Configurateion

 SMTP - port 25 to push or send mail out to addresses
 POP3 & IMAP4 - TCP - ports 110,143 - delivered from sender

 Microsoft 365 - files are not synced unless sharepoint added, cloud storage available. google workspace

 Active Sync - protocol for MS Exchange Server for mobile devicesprimary
    users access email, calenedar, contacts and tasks
    admins can remote wipe , enforce passowrd policies and enable encryptiopn
    iOS and Android can use ActiveSync

Syncing Apple iOS Devices 
MAC OS
    installed by default
    ios devices automatically synced

Physical Memory
    isolating causes require extensive troubleshooting practices
        record addresses indicated in error messages
        reboot, and observe if error is repeated
        compare addresses from various error messages 
            if similar, problem may be due to physical RAM issue
Virtual Memory - is on the hard drive
    memory processes involving a paging file (pagefile.sys) on the hard disk drive
        suppplements memory capacity installed on the motherboard
    issues caused by inadequate RAM capacity and less than 10 percent free disk space
Slow performance
    task manager
        processes tab displays usage of CPU, memory, disk access, and network traffic
            demands placed on the CPU to include memory usage by all processes
            disk access such as transfers between the paging file and memory
        processes using huge amount of the resource may need to be stopped
        displays used and free space on the hard disk
        less than 10 percent of free space
            disk cleanup frees up disk space by deleting unnecessary content
            manually delete unneeded files
            move user-created files
