Physical Security Concepts
    Access Controle Vestibule - aka mantrap, helps to prevent nonauthorized users from tailgaiting. ACV is a small room that has two controlled doors. one door opens for you, let in, closed and then the next door opens. Prevents unauthorized access to secure areas.

    Badge Reader - Identification badges used for proof of access. for entry to restricted areas. Creates and electronic audit.
        Photo ID
        Magnetic Strip or RFID
    
    Video Surveillance - backbone of physical security. fixed and pan-tilt-zoom. PTZ cameras used to scan a larger area, but an intruder could possibly elude fom being recorded
    CCTV - closed circuit television. Coaxial Cable but limited to 100m segments.
    Ethernet is most common on new installations, exceeds limitations of CCTV. Network Video Recorder (NVR) is a server function. Seperate LAN segment.

    Motion Sensor
        Sensor Types

        Passive infrared tracks zones of infrared radiation signature. Affordable and most commonly used.

        Microwave Detector is similar in appearance to PIR sensorys without a reflectife front panel. Costly an dsuscpetigle to external interference.

        Vibrations sensors are seismic sensors. detect earth tremors. used in physial security.

    Alarm System - illegal access, commonly used to detect breakins. 

    door locks - tumbler and key. mechanical or electronical.

    Concepts
        Perimiter Security
        Security Guards
        Fences
        Bollards
        Motion sensors
        Alarm System
        Door locks
        Equipment Locks

    Security for staff, specifying who is aurthorized to access what. equipment used to process and store sensitive data.

    Key fobs use RFID for close proximity.

    RFID badges operate at a 125kHz. 

Logical Security

    Principle of least privilege - restricts users permissions. assign permissions appropriate for job roles. to enable users to complete their assigned tasks. Types of permission for least privilege, read only, write, list folder contents.

    Access control lists - control network traffic and applications. uses condition-based actions (defauld action when a condidtion is not met). Default sction - deny traffic from accessing network resources.
    
    Multifactor authentication
    Email
    Hard and Soft Token
    Voice Call
    Authenticator Application

    Authentication Factors
    Something you know
        Password or Pin
            increase password strength with complexity

    Mobile Device Management
        Mobile workforce and telecommuting
            job tasks performed abroad and from home
        Routine use of mobile devices
            laptops, tablets and smartphones
                company issued or personally owned
        Organizations network resources
            remotely accessible over the internet
                from the companys LAN or via cloud services.

        Requires policies to govern their use.
            when accessingnetwork resource remotely
                specifically with personally owened devices
        MDN Software
            Dictates BYOD pollicy on specific issues
                employee terminations, lost device, password use.
                primarily to protect company data
        Scaleable directory service for objects
            includes printers, users, and computers
        Uses LDAP (389) to look up objects
            Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
        Does not authenticate
            uses kerberos to authenticate users
        
        Domain
            Authentication throught domain access Token
            Keys for various resource ACLs (locks)
            Authentication agains AD domain
                key issued to individual users
                key issued from users group membership
            User access of file secured with ACL
                Access granted when token and credentials match

        Ourganizational Units (OUs)
            organizes objects into respective security groups. Allows set of policies be applied to objects.

            GPO assigns those policies and we enforce those policies with GPupdate gpforce.

    Malware
        software written wtih malicious intent 
        often referred to as various
            distinct difference from Malware
        Variety of malware forms
            covert cryptomining
            web search redirection
            adware, spyware and ransomware

    Ransomware
        Form of extortion
        Establishes control of a computers
            hard drive encryption
            manipulating user credentials
        Relinquishes control in exchange for payment
            hands over code to overide restrictions.
        Cyrptolocker
            world wide attacks on healthcare faciliteis
            held patient records for ransomware
            in exchange for bitcoin payment to third-party
        Mitigation through compliance
            Maintain updates of antimalware definitions
            Install OS patches as they become available

    Trojan
        Disguises itself as a legitimate program
        Included as part of an installation program
            Creates a backdoor or replaces a valid program
        Able to remain undetected for years
            While compromising security measures
        Port scan may detect its existence
            unsupported TCP or UDP port opened by an application can be determined
        Best preventive emeasure
            perform backups
            before and after installing new software or OS
            Reinstall original version of program 
                if suspect presence of Trojan horse after the installation of programs updated version
        
        Keyloggers
            Software used to record keystrokes
