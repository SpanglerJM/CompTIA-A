Scripting and Remote Access
    Programming: uses low level programming level. requires compiling before being executed. has direct access to hardware like CPU.
    Scripting: uses high level programming language. does not require compiling before being executed. Indirect CPU access. do not create functions, only call on.
    Interpreters: scripts are interpreted/ translated from a shell command line or external interpreter. Reads each line of script. Executes as instruction.
    Applications: are written to perform funcitons.
    Variable: symbolic word for combination of letters, holds a value. Integer. Text. Boolean. True Values and arrays. cannot be a reserved word.
    Environment Variable: holds value in scripts for system or user. can be over written individually. System > USer > Program.
